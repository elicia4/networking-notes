# Difference Between IPv4 & IPv6

An IP address is: 
- a numeric address 
- an identifier for a computer/device on a network
- every device has to have an IP address for communication purposes
- consists of two parts: a network & host addresses
- 2 types: IPv4 & IPv6

IPv4 is: 
- the most widespread version of IP addresses.
- 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods, e.g.:
`66.94.234.13`. 
- ~4.3 billion unique addresses (2^32 = 4,294,967,296)

Each group of numbers separated by periods is called an octet. The number range
within each octet is 0-255 (2^8).

IPv6:
- next generation of IP addresses
- IPv6 is significantly longer, it's a 128bit hexadecimal address, 8 sets of 16
bits, e.g: `76DC:4F59:76DC:4F59:76DC:4F59`
- ~340 undecillion (~340 * 10^36) addresses (2^128)
