Access Control Lists:

Purpose of an access list is to identify traffic
	ACLs applied to interfaces are sometimes called "Packet Filters"

Only one Packet Filter ACL can be applied:
	per Interface, per Direction, per IP Protocol

Two types of ACLs:
	Standard - matches on Source IP
	Extended - matches on Src IP, Dest IP, Src Port, Dest Port, Protocol

Two ways to configure ACLs (i.e., syntax):
	Numbered
	Named
Either set of syntax can be used to configure either type of ACL.

This file describes how to configure Numbered ACLs.

Syntax for a Numbered Standard ACL:
	
	access-list <ID#> <action> <source>

Syntax for a Numbered Extended ACL:

	access-list <ID#> <action> <protocol> <source> <destination>

access-list - command to configure Numbered ACL

<#ID> - ID Number which links multiple entries together, each access-list
entry is an ID number and then a match statement, what links multiple entries
together is the ID number. That is the purpose of an ID number, it allows you
to link multiple entries into one ACL. (ACE = access list entry, series of ACEs
makes an ACL). ID number is also how you will refer to the ACL elsewhere in the
configuration. The number itself is very significant:
	Standard ACL = 1-99 OR 1300-1999
	Extended ACL = 100-199 OR 2000-2699

<action>
	permit - Accept traffic
	deny - Reject traffic

	permit and deny are relative to how ACL is applied

	remark - comment, ignore in packet processing. This will turn the rest of
	the syntax into a text field, and you can type whatever you want

<protocol> - you can filter on different protocols.
	ip - match IP traffic (i.e., all IPv4 traffic)
	tcp - match TCP traffic (ports specified later)
	udp - match UDP traffic (ports specified later)
	icmp - match ICMP traffic (ping, traceroute, etc...)
	Lot's more: gre, esp, ahp, etc...

<source> or <destination>
	Either are defined with: <IP Adresses> [Port]
	To match a Subnet: <NetID> <Wildcard Mask>
	To match a single IP address: host <#.#.#.#>
	To match ALL IP addresses: any

	To match a specified port: eq <#>
	To specify a range of ports: range <#> <#> (INCLUDING BOTH)
	Other qualifiers: gt <#> / lt <#> / neq <#> (greater than, less than, not
	equal)
	
	The port section is optional

Some example configurations are presented in the next note.
